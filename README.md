# Apache-Licenser
This is a script consisting of APACHE 2.0 License and a script that will help you license your work by passing some arguments to it.

For instance, an example execution of this script should be something like this:

Open Up a Terminal with existing Python in the system and put the following command:
  python3 licenser.py -filelist_path FILELIST_PATH [-company_name COMPANY_NAME] [-project_name [PROJECT_NAME ...]] [-developer_name [DEVELOPER_NAME ...]] [-functionality [FUNCTIONALITY ...]]     
                   [-project_name_norepeat] -language LANGUAGE [LANGUAGE ...]

The description of each of the switches can be understood from help. Please write the following to get some help:
  python3 lincenser.py --help

This development is open to suggestions.
