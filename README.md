# Apache-Licenser
This is a script consisting of APACHE 2.0 License and a script that will help you license your work by passing some arguments to it.

For instance, an example execution of this script should be something like this:

Open Up a Terminal with existing python in the system and put the following command:
  python3 licenser.py [-h] [-company_name COMPANY_NAME] [-project_name PROJECT_NAME] [-developer_name [DEVELOPER_NAME ...]] [-functionality [FUNCTIONALITY ...]]

The description of each of the switches can be understood from help. Please write the following to get some help:
  python3 lincenser.py --help

This development is open for suggestions.
